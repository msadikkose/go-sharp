GoSharp
Introduction
Welcome to [GoSharp], a unique repository designed to showcase practical examples and use cases similar to those found in C# projects, adapted for Go (Golang). This project serves as a bridge for developers coming from a C# background or those interested in exploring how certain concepts may be implemented in Go, despite not strictly adhering to Go's conventional best practices.

Disclaimer
Before diving into the code, it's important to acknowledge that this project intentionally deviates from some of the established Go programming paradigms and best practices. The design decisions and coding styles adopted here might reflect more closely those found in C# projects, resulting in patterns that are not typically recommended in Go development communities.

The primary goal is to offer a different perspective and to provide examples that might be more familiar to developers transitioning from C# to Go, or for educational purposes where comparing implementations across languages can be insightful.

What to Expect
Example Usages: The repository contains a variety of examples that demonstrate specific functionalities or patterns implemented in Go, mirroring approaches commonly used in C#.
Learning Opportunities: For developers interested in the nuances between Go and C#, this project can serve as a comparative study tool.
Unconventional Patterns: While the project does not conform to Go's standard best practices, it offers a unique take on problem-solving within the Go ecosystem.
